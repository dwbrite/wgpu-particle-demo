# wgpu-particle-demo
Pretty particles!

I've developed this in Windows and Linux with some testing from a friend on MacOS.
It's easy to build, run, and distribute - though it does require some nightly features.

I've seen upwards of 500k particles drawn at 60FPS on an M1 Macbook _in Firefox_. And trust me there is _lots_ of room for improvement.

To me, this is the magic of wgpu and one of the reasons I love Rust and its ecosystem :)
